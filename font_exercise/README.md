Google Web Fonts
==============

Learn all about them [here](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started).

## Exercise

Produce at least one HTML page that uses three (3) different Google Web fonts: 

* One for the H1 heading,
* Another for a large-font introduction paragraph after the H1, and 
* A third for the regular paragraph text of the page. 

You may use [Lorem Ipsum text](http://www.lipsum.com/) for the paragraphs. 

Do _not_ embed any CSS styles in the HTML page â€” put them all in a separate CSS file. 

## Good advice

[CSS Typography: Techniques and Best Practices](http://sixrevisions.com/css/css-typography-02/) -- read it! 

In combining different fonts together on one page, it's important to pay attention to how the fonts complement one another. Weight, size, and shapes of letters all play a part in either harmony or discord among fonts.

Be prepared to explain the difference between: 

1. The use of Google Web fonts, and 
2. The use of @font-face. 

Any Web designer needs to understand which one is better, and why, as well as the _consequences_ of either choice.
